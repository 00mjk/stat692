The data are available in the file `/afs/cs.wisc.edu/p/stat/Data/MS.exam/f11/sleepTranscriptome.txt`.  The file is described as having 36 columns and 45101 rows.  It was created on a Mac which may cause problems with the line endings.

```{r read}
ff <- read.delim('/afs/cs.wisc.edu/p/stat/Data/MS.exam/f11/sleepTranscriptome.txt')
```

```{r }
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(ff,aes(x=X1BS_08172011_.Mouse430_2..CEL))
p + geom_density()
```

The fact that the density plot shows a hard edge on the left hand side could mean that the range would be interesting to examine.
